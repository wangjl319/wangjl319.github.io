## Welcome

I am Jialai Wang 王佳来 (pronounced as [Wáng Jiā Lái](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=王佳来) ). I am currently a undergraduate student in **School of Instrument Science and Opto-electronics Engineering, Hefei University of Technology**.

I am interested in a variety of topics in astronomy, such as stars, planets, galaxy formation and evolution, cosmology, supernova, astronomical observations, instrumentation and data analysis. I have attended _the 2nd Zhejiang Province Astronomy Olympiad_ and won the First Price. I also have attended _the Final of China National Astronomy Olympiad_ in 2017. In the future, I'm eager to develop expertise on various topics of astronomy and astrophysics.
